# LightBar

The goal of this project is to replace my Room Light with an LED Bar around the top edge of my Room.
I'm using 10m SK6812 RGBW LEDs and an atmega328p.

## Hardware
* SK6812 RGBW LEDs [Datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/2757/p2757_SK6812RGBW_REV01.pdf)
* Arduino nano with atmega328p [Datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATmega328PB-Automotive-Data-Sheet-40001980B.pdf)
